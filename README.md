Music and Sound: A Visual Exploration
Part A: Dynamic Visuals Inspired by Music

Part A transforms a song into an immersive and interactive visual experience. At the heart of the visualization is a glowing, pulsating circle that synchronizes perfectly with the beat of the music, creating a rhythmic energy that draws the viewer’s attention. Surrounding this central circle, colorful, fluid waves dynamically react to the frequencies of the song, moving and flowing in harmony with the audio data.

The interactivity enhances the user experience—clicking anywhere on the screen allows you to play or pause the music effortlessly. The canvas seamlessly resizes to fill the entire screen, ensuring the visuals remain centered, smooth, and visually appealing regardless of display size.

This dynamic visualization is powered by tools from the p5.js sound library. The p5.FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) function processes the song's frequency data, breaking it into visual components, while the p5.Amplitude function tracks the overall volume, enabling the pulsing effect. Together, these tools bring the visuals to life with vibrant gradients, smooth wave animations, and a sense of motion that mirrors the song's rhythm and energy.

Part B: Static Visual Representation of Sound

Part B takes a different approach, focusing on capturing the essence of an entire song in a single, static visualization. By processing the full track PartB.mp3 with the getPeaks() function from the p5.js sound library, the song's amplitude data was extracted and mapped onto the canvas as a series of smooth, symmetrical waveforms. These waveforms stretch across the screen, visually representing the song’s highs, lows, and energy flow.

At the center of the canvas sits a radiant, gradient-filled circle, which acts as a focal point and symbolizes the heart of the song. This glowing circle is framed by a vibrant, colorful background gradient that enhances the artwork, giving it a polished, poster-like aesthetic.

The goal behind this static visualization is to translate sound into art—a visual snapshot of the music's energy and rhythm. The waveforms reflect the intricate peaks and dips of the song, while the layered design and color gradients work together to create an engaging and artistic representation of sound. The final result is a piece that feels dynamic and alive, despite being entirely static.

Creative Intent and Song Selection

Both parts were designed to showcase the beauty of sound throcan notuals, turning audio into something tangible and visually expressive. While the two songs used were non-copyrighted tracks, their exact names were not retained, as they were primarily chosen for their creative flexibility and copyright-free availability.

This project merges technology, music, and art, offering both interactive and static interpretations of sound. Part A captures the energy and movement of live music, while Part B freezes a song's rhythm and amplitude into a vibrant, artistic composition. Together, they present sound as a visual medium—something you can not only hear but also see and feel.
